# Prelab-2

IDEA GENERATION: The point of this week's lab is to figure out a cool interaction that you can make possible with the timer capabilities of the micro controller. You could make a game where people have to try to press a button more times than their friend in a certain amount of time. You could make something that sings you to sleep, and gets quieter and quieter over 3 minutes. You could make something that you hit as you start to run down a hall, and then hit again, to see how fast you can run.

1. 'Simon Says' w multiple pitches/buttons - timer speeds up sequentially
2. Press multiple buttons to represent sounds within a certain time set by the user -> then plays back your "song"
3. When tone 1 is played, P1 presses button, when tone 2 is played, P2 presses their button - timer speeds up every round until someone incorrectly presses or misses
4. Alarm clock - song slowly gets louder as time goes on/for each snooze
5. Workout timer - tone plays every time the exercise changes
6. Metronome - Use bottons to increase/decrease speed
7. Cooking timer
8. 'Pictionary' DIY timer
9. Players each hold a button and release at X seconds (known but not displayed), whoever is closest to releasing at exactly X seconds wins
10. 'Guess' metronome i.e. pick/play X bpm and players try to match the bpm for some time interval by pressing a button to the beat, whoever is closest wins
